## ⚠️ TRANSFORMATION RULES

**DO:**
- Keep same model pose angle for seamless morph
- Use consistent lighting throughout
- BEFORE should look "real" and relatable
- AFTER should be aspirational, glamorous

**DON'T:**
- Jump cut between before/after (must morph)
- Change model's position during transition
- Make BEFORE look unrealistically bad
- Rush the transformation (needs full 8s)
